					<h4>Survey and download links</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The ThrenoScope is a research project. In addition to my own research questions (see publications) I'm interested in how people use the system in their own music. I'd like to be able to contact users to ask questions, most likely in the form of sending a link to an online survey.
				</p>

				<p>For this reason I have created a registration page which takes you to the download links of the ThrenoScope. I hope you don't mind giving your email addresse and answering a few questions. This won't take more than a couple of minutes, but it will benefit my research.
